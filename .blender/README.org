#+title: Project-local Blender directories
#+options: toc:1 num:nil

This directory is used for *project-local* Blender state so builds are more reproducible and don’t depend on your global Blender profile.

The Makefile sets these environment variables:
- =BLENDER_USER_CONFIG= -> =.blender/user_config/=
- =BLENDER_USER_SCRIPTS= -> =.blender/user_scripts/=
- =BLENDER_USER_EXTENSIONS= -> =.blender/user_extensions/=

These subdirectories are ignored by git (see =.gitignore=).

You normally should not commit anything under this folder.
If you decide to vendor a Blender extension, put the extension zip under:
- =vendor/extensions/=
