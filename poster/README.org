#+title: Poster pipeline
#+options: toc:2 num:nil

* Files
- =manifest.json= : edit this to add assets, text, image planes, and configure camera/render.
- =blendlib.py= : “scene compiler” called by =open.py= and =render.py=.
- =open.py= : entrypoint used when launching Blender UI.
- =render.py= : entrypoint used for headless rendering.

* Object kinds supported (initial)
** text
Creates/updates a 3D text object.

Minimal fields:
- =name=
- =kind= "text"
- =space= "POSTER" or "WORLD"
- =text=
- =style= (optional; refers to =styles=)

** image_plane
Creates a plane with a PNG texture (useful for logos, micrographs, schematics).

Minimal fields:
- =name=
- =kind= "image_plane"
- =space= "POSTER" or "WORLD"
- =image_path=
- =size_mm= [width, height]

** import_glb
Imports a GLB file and wraps it under a stable Empty root with your chosen name.

Minimal fields:
- =name=
- =kind= "import_glb"
- =filepath=

** import_wrl
Imports a WRL file (requires VRML importer extension) and wraps it similarly.
Prefer converting WRL -> GLB and using =import_glb= for the poster build.

Optional field:
- =import_scale= : multiplier applied right after import (useful for normalizing WRL units)

* Notes
This is a starter pipeline. We will likely add:
- CAD-style arrows/callouts
- “explosion” controls (drivers) for grouped models
- compositing so overlays always render above the 3D model
