#+title: Vendored Blender extensions
#+options: toc:1 num:nil

Optional: place Blender 5 extension zip files here if you want a fully offline/reproducible setup.

Example use-case:
- Web3D X3D/VRML2 importer extension (to import =.wrl= / =.x3d= assets)

If you vendor an extension zip here, you can add a Makefile target later to install it into the project-local extension directory.
